General Description
===================

GibRack is a mod I have been working on. I don't have a modeller yet, so I didn't quite
make any items or weapons yet, however i have already successfully made a few features.

================
General Features
================

Severe Monster AI Improvement - its going to be hard

Improved Item Ejection When Dying - when you die instead of just throughing your weapon you throw everything

Head Shots - four times the damage

Blood - shoot an enemy with a bullet and his gut will appear on the opposite wall or the floor

Controllable Turrets - when a turret_driver dies it becomes a turret_seat(see map items)

Better Obituary - obituary messages for any death of player or monster from any reason at any game mode

Visible Bullets - thats for the gl players, you can see bullets flying, software users may be able to look closely enough

Coop Exit - in coop all players must exit the level before the level changes, and from the same exit

Weapons tweaking - inhanced power for some weapons, and go-through-wall charging railgun

Wall climbing - player can now climb almost any ledge or crack in a wall, hold jump to grab, press forward to climb

========
Bindings
========

chasecam - it's not the standard old chasecam, although it serves the same porpuse, try it and see

+use - bind it, it works with some of the features

======
C_Vars
======

set lives <-1,0-9> s - in single player and coop it allowes you to respawn in the same situation you died as long as you have lives left, 0 disable, -1 infinite

set coop-
1-"Cooperative", the standard
2-"Quick-Run", all the rules of coop, exapt scoring is made by kill/secret/goal ratio minus time

set deathmatch-
1-"FragFest", the standard
2-"DeathMatch"(literaly), you get a limited amount of lives(see #4), when you run out you go to intermission, until only one player/team remains, infinite lives are not allowed, 0 lives to make realistic killing
3-"Fox-Hunt", the level+scoring rules of coop, level exit rules of deathmatch, lives act like in "DeathMatch", infinite allowed, killing another player brings special penalty(see set foxhunt_penalty)

set foxhunt_penalty <0-inf> s - the score penalty for killing a player in fox-hunt, a negative number would mean a reward for such killing and is therefore not advised (default=10)

set gibflags -
1-Real Damage-all damage is 4 times stronger, even from monsters, quad is disabled(too strong)
2-Coop Respawn-in single player when you die(and finish your lives) you respawn like in coop
4-With Monsters-for deathmatch with monsters, monsters don't count as frags
8-Must Use-doors, buttons, and step on platforms must be activated with +use(see bindings)
16-Must Look-when activating doors, and buttons you must look at them(don't open with your back)

set teamplay <0/1> s - enable/disable gibrack style teamplay(see set team)

set team <teamname> u - much more useful than model/skin teams

=============
Maps Included
=============

Two levels to demonstrate other features - gang.bsp and actor.bsp (in gang.bsp make the light guard shoot one of the enforcers and see what happens)

=========
Map Items
=========

item_irgoggles - "ir goggles" - makes it easier to find living objects in dark or light

item_powerscreen - "power screen" - implemented what id had already created

item_adrenaline - exept for the old functionality if lives is enabled(not 0) it adds another life even if you have max

turret_seat - replace a turret_driver in your map to this and players will be able to control the turret, +use to fire(see bindings)

Future Plans
============

New weapons, enemys, items, and perhaps maps.

Backpacks - each backpack has its own propeties, like jetpack, auto grappling hook, shield and more.

Grappling assembly with 2 hooks, one is an arrow with a rope(standard), and the other a ninja rope, if both are shot at 2 directions u can use the grapple to slide from one to another.

Swinging Grapple.
